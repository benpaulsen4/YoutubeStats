# Awards Guide
## What are awards?
Awards are a fun new way of viewing analytics data for creators across group lines. Each award measures a specific metric of performance, and provides a medal to the top 3 placing creators. These medals can be seen in the analytics table 
next to the creators name, in addition to the awards section at the bottom of the report.

Each award is measured in a unit, either a number of subscribers, a percentage, or a multiplier (times value). When displaying the award recipients, the values will be displayed next to each name in its respective unit.
